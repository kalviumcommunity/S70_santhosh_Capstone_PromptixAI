PromptixAI Capstone Project Proposal
Duration: 7 Weeks
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase, OpenAI, Stripe, Docker, Jest

 1. Project Overview
🔹 Why PromptixAI?
The demand for AI-generated images is growing rapidly across industries like marketing, content creation, and gaming. However, most AI image-generation tools are either too complex or lack accessibility for beginners.
PromptixAI solves this by offering:  A user-friendly platform to generate AI-powered images using text prompts.
1.Real-time AI processing with OpenAI's DALL·E API.
2. Authentication & personalization, allowing users to save and manage their generated images.
3. Credit-based model, where users can buy credits via Stripe for additional image generations.
4. File upload & management, enabling users to store and showcase their AI-generated images.
With PromptixAI, users can explore AI creativity, generate high-quality visuals, and build their own AI-powered art gallery.
